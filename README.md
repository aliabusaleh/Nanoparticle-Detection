# Nanoparticle-Detection
In this project, we will use image processing to detect nanoparticles (e.g., bacteria and fine dust) in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) images. SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE (SPR) imaging for quantification and analysis of nanoparticles in liquid or air samples. This the project aims to detect the nanoparticles using an application which will be used to get the the primary situation of samples either itâ€™s infected by the virus or not instead of using neural network which requires super-computer and consume a massive amount of power compared to the normal application, using the spatial domain for detection was the the solution we used to get the 89% detection.
